The test and coverage badges are updated by the `main` branch CI workflow from the
JUnit and V8 coverage reports produced by the tests on the latest commit.

Nomo is a gamified restaurant discovery platform that turns eating out into an ongoing journey rather than a series of disconnected restaurant searches — combining personalized recommendations, location-based exploration, gamification, and rewards.

**Core loop:** Discover → Visit → Complete → Earn → Unlock → Explore Further
